                        Building an AI Chip Saved Google from Building a Dozen New Data Centers
                        As a company experiences constant growth and expansion in its market, the amount of data increases. This necessitates an improvement to be done on how the data will be handled in order to keep up with the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery to the clients. When Google launched its voice recognition services, the amount of data that was streaming in to their servers increased at a very high rate.

                        This made it necessary for them to find a way of increasing their storage capacity. They chose to build an AI chip (the Tensor Processing Unit) that would help them manage the large amounts of data, over increasing the number of their server units. The choice was very wise because it was less costly and more efficient compared to building new data centers. The chip is much more energy efficient and it manages the execution of neural networks.
